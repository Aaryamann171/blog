For the past year or so I was using simple HTML/CSS for my website. It was fine for the time being I guess but now it’s time to move up as **JAMstack** is the future and new is always better.

## Why though?

Recently I started working on some projects at work built using **Next.js** and my first impressions were largely positive.

I decided to use Next.js as it comes with pretty decent routing out of the box and I found it to be very intuitive. Getting the website up and running was pretty straightforward. I am passing data to different components using props, nothing fancy. For styling, I went with **Bootstrap v5.0** because it's convenient. In the near future, I am considering moving to Tailwind CSS because all the cool kids are using it these days.

I’ll probably spend more time on the UI/UX part of the website in the coming days/weeks, for now, my goal was to just get it up and running. I am using GitHub pages to deploy it using GitHub actions, it was relatively easy but I did run into some issues when I tried exporting it to a static website. But nothing a few google searches couldn’t fix.

## Future Projects

I have a couple of small projects in my mind that I want to tackle in my free time and I think I’ll stick with Next.js for now. A little down the line I want to start a slightly larger scale project and where I can explore some more shiny new libraries and frameworks.
