A few days back I completed 365 days of code, basically, I decided to make atleast 1 commit in my repositories everyday for one year. The reason why I did this was simple, I wanted to improve my skills and I had a lot of free time on my hand.

I started off with basic DSA questions then got distracting and started tweaking my [dotfiles](https://github.com/aaryamann171/config), I was obssessed with [*ricing*](https://thatnixguy.github.io/posts/ricing/) my setup. It was my way of procastinating and feeling good about myself. Then I worked on some interesting stuff, dabbled with **shell scripting**, picked up **ReactJS** for a while, played around with upcoming python frameworks like **Streamlit** (I even managed to deploy a fun weekend project [here](https://share.streamlit.io/aaryamann171/fang-stonks/main/streamlit_app.py)), re-developed my digital portfolio using **NextJS** and started this blog using **Jekyll** and **GitHubPages** shortly after that. I also started coding in **C++** for some reason. At this point in time I felt really good about myself, I felt like I could build anything I wanted.\
Looking back I can see that I was at the Peak of "Mount Stupid".\

Naturally, I fell down pretty hard. It took me a while to realise I was stuck in **tutorial purgatory**. I really struggled when it came to logic building and actually solving problems. I looked at people in the coding space that have developed some amazing projects and have started whole companies with the software they wrote in their bedroom. I realised how far behind I was when it came to problem solving and actually applying DSA to problems. The current state of technical interviews in the *real world* clearly favors people who have spent several hours grinding **Leet Code**.\
There are already several youtube videos/medium articles where people with much more experience than me have rant about this issue, I don't think I can add anything meaningful to the constant whining.

Anyways, to feel good about myself and feel like an *real programmer* I started practing questions on GeeksForGeeks and Codeforces, I'm still not great at it. I still struggle to come up with the most optimal solution, but I am getting there. My 365 day journey started with me playing around with config files and ended with me shilling for the DSA grind.

From what I can tell I am still stuck somewhere in the Valley of Despair, but atleast I am moving towards the slope, however slow that may be. My biggest takeaway would be consistency (shocking, I know!) is more important that griding really hard for a few months just to *Crack the Coding Interview*, I really did learn alot by just by showing up everyday. There were days when I didn't want to code at all and I just ended up playing around with fancy python features or libraries. Even that was better than nothing.

Overall, it was pretty fun. I would probably keep going forward with this challenge, all the green in my profile is the only thing that keeps me going at this point in my life.
