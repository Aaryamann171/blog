I remember writing a long caption on one of my instagram posts back in 2017 after I gave my final board exam. I felt like things were going to change going forward. I thought I'd miss my friends and cherish these memories forever. I even wrote some corny one liner like _"...for the sake of those memories we live on"_, pretty sure I stole it from some other pretentious dude on instagram. 

It's 4 years later and I am graduating from college, sure the variables are different, but it's the same feeling. Nothing **_really_** changes. It's okay to feel lost after such big moments, I am told. But I don't really feel anything. The college life was over the moment they announced a 2 week break for some cough causing infection, we all know how that turned out.

Even though the pandemic disrupted the last 1 year or so of my college life, looking back, I don't really think I did anything worth remembering. Sure, I made some friends, worked on some exciting projects and made some "memories". But overall, I had a very generic experience, there is a reason why every mass appealing stand up gig feels so relatable, we all have the same shitty story and that we somehow feel is unique to us. Talk to any graduate and they'll tell you about their _memories for life_ trip to some low budget hill station was and will be the best moment of their entire life. Even if that's half true, it's really depressing.

Online convocations are boring and uninspiring to say the least. You see people trying their best to find the lowest common denominator to force a sense of nostalgia out of you. _Remember that one place near campus that served [edible_item]! We all **loved** that! Remember bunking classes to hang out at [random_location_1] that was amazing!_. You can fill in these placeholders and make it about any college in the world. I wonder if I would've felt something if it was in person.

I have never been too optimistic about the future, but for the first time I am excited for what's about to come. It's going to be a long road ahead, there is so much I want to do. Even if I fail at most of them, it'll still be a worth it. Obviously I have learned a lot in the past 4 years and I am sure it'll be useful going forward. But it's important not to stay too attached to the past. Like some idiot once said, **_for the sake of those memories we live on!_**
