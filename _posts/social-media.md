Signal recently added the much beloved `Stories` feature to the application. I received the update today, and they announced the changes using the cool kids way of breaking news, `changelog stories`. I was skeptical at first, but then I saw that they had also provided an option to opt out of stories entirely. I was pleasantly surprised. I am so glad I successfully convinced all 5 of my friends to use signal. I thought the goal of applications was to enforce the shiny new things on the user to improve their metrics. I guess there is a difference between open source community apps and apps run by billion dollar Goliath. 

Staying on the topic of messaging apps for a while, I am a strong proponent of messaging apps staying messaging apps, you don't need to add stories or online shopping. Businesses start spamming your account with random promotional BS and offers. Luckily, we have stop communications options (as of writing this). I'd love to live in a world which accepted RCS, and we could just use simple text messages to communicate. But rather, we live in a world dominated by Apple, which would rather lose users than adopt RCS for iPhones. 

This update from signal got me thinking about how cool it would be if we could opt out of certain features from these social media applications. I'd love to turn off reels from my Instagram account. How cool it would've been if we had an open source social network. Without telemetry, without any targeted ads, where the user had an option to turn off reels/shorts whatever you want to call them. Modern chat messenger with `Vanish Mode` and `view once` snaps. The current Instagram messenger is perfect in my opinion (apart from the lack of end-to-end encryption of course and the obvious). Stories are cool IMHO (for social media apps), option to react/reply to stories is a must. They act as a nice icebreaker for people trying to ***slide into the dms***. That's how modern love stories begin. I also like the idea of having the messaging app separate from the main app, like Facebook did back in the day (maybe they still do? Haven't used Facebook since 2016).

This however seems highly unlikely as it'll make people spend less time on the app. The constant reel binging is good for the top line. The major issue I still feel will the lack of interest from the Normies. All social media apps fail without the Network Effect. But a guy can dream. I hope someone creates something that can replace the dumpster fire we have today with something better.
