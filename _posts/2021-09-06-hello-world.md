Had to start with one of the biggest clich√©s in programming to set the perfect precedence for this blog. I am pretty sure it'll be something I'll look back on with cringe, so pretty much like anything else I have done in life.

## Why does this exists?

Like all gen-z kids I feel the need to put my thoughts on the internet because I am _oh so special_.
But mainly because I am **bored**.

## Will it provide the reader any meaningful insights?

No, it's pretty much me shitposting like it's early 2000s.
