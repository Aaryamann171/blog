For the past couple of months, I have been probably going through what my generation refers to as *existential crisis* or *typical gen-z* shit as the boomers call it. A friend of mine referred to a similar feeling as a "quarter life crisis". Either way, the way I see most people dealing with such problems is through [wireheading](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/wireheading). So I did what anyone else would do I binged popular shows to keep with the memes and joneses. Caught up with MCU, witnessed the death of James Bond and binged Euphoria. Spitting in the face of my hatred for the monoculture. Joined Instagram again because aparently, my social life depends on it. I was away from all this for a while now, but now there is always someone or something that brings me back to it. I don't really hate IG, like I do other social media websites though. I believe IG in its best promotes beauty and creativity. What I despise is the rise in influencer culture and meme milking. But that's a topic for some other day.

What I realized is pretty much everyone I know has become some sort of a [p-zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie). To be fair, I don't say this is from a point of superiority, I am just as bad if not worse when it comes to shitposting on social media or binging the latest overhyped show. More often than not, I chose to do things that would look cooler on IG stories as compared to things I would do if I genuinely didn't care about any of that. We are all wireheaded junkies waiting for our next fix. On to the next **happening**. Our narrative of life is that we just sit there and consume content. Not that these so called content creators have it any better.

This is the part where, if I was a good blogger would give you 10 tips on "How I beat Procrastination  and Wireheading, And You Can Too!" with some *relatable af* gifs and fresh memes sprinkled here and there. I would tell you how things are going to change and how you can use "Social Media To Your Advantage by following these Easy Steps!". But to be honest, I am just as clueless as you are.
