Believe it or not, I have a couple of readers on this blog now, shocking, I know. But don't worry this newly found success won't affect the terrible shitpost quality of this blog in any way.

Coming back to today's rant, let's talk about the state of technology circa 2022. Everything we do on the <s>computer</s> *internet* which is pretty much where my generation, the generation before me, and thanks to facebook the generation even before them spends most of the time is meticulously logged and analyzed. To serve you better **of course**. Our data is sold to the highest bidder for stakeholder profit. The algorithm rules us all. There is an app for everything.

Here's a crazy idea. Think about everything that's part of the internet, which is *pretty much everything* these days. **'COS WE THE PEOPLE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE SMART!**<br> Bear with me for a minute. Imagine this entire shtick as a superintelligence that wanted to influence our opinions. Think of it as the [Prime Intellect](http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopiidx.html). But only with one limitation, it can only exist in the virtual world. PI here has **"magical"** powers. It can change the way you think, things you buy, manipulate the thoughts in your head, chose the people you will meet this weekend, what you will do when you are bored, and have a second to think about anything you want in the world. Sounds like a far-fetched paranoid mind conjured theory right?

But what if we are already there? The songs in my head are the ones shoved in my face by reels, my playlist is nothing but spotify recommendations, my amazon cart is full of things I don't really need but I buy anyway, my weekend plans revolve around people I swiped right on or an old friend I suddenly remembered and wanted to meet because of something that randomly popped up on my feed and now I *have* to see them, my free time is consumed by youtube and netflix recommendations, the brief moment of motivation I feel to start working out again comes from this random nugget of wisdom dropped in on me by reddit, my idea of aesthetics is ruled by pinterest. My wardrobe is full of clothes recommended by myntra. Do we have food recommendations on zomato yet?

And why do I feel compelled to pull out my phone whenever something even remotely interesting or out of the norm happens and add it to my story? Why do I feel the need to share my every thought on the internet as if it was some original piece of literature too precious to be lost in the void of my intellect? And yes, the irony of me writing this on my blog and sharing it with my "close friends" on the internet isn't lost on me.

All aspects of our lives are dictated by algorithms way more complex than our paleolithic hunter-gatherer brains can comprehend. The machines won a long time ago. Sorry, no leather-clad shady dude is offering you a red pill, no evil robot dropping a giant rock on Sokovia or Westworld robots trying to infiltrate our society. Reality is often disappointing as the meme goes. Free will was always a myth. Our actions may have been driven by unknown variables or black-box models computed in our unconscious back in the day, but now it's all driven by code written by a bunch of people no smarter than you are.

But what do I know, this blogpost only exists because I had too much coffee and woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't go back to sleep. I am just some random guy on the internet with unfounded biased opinions.
